   Otus Lisp is a purely[*](#pure) functional dialect of Lisp.
It implements an extended subset of [R<sup>5</sup>RS](http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/) Scheme including, but not limited to, some of the [SRFI](http://srfi.schemers.org/). It is small, embeddable and crossplatform.

   You can use it on Linux (CentOS, Debian, Fedora, RHEL, SLE, ScientificLinux, Uninvention, openSUSE, Ubuntu, etc.), Windows, *BSD, Android, webOS, Odroid. It runs on x86, arm, aarch64, mips, ppc architectures with 32- and 64-bit platforms.

### Summary (continue)

   You can immediately try Otus Lisp (ol) in the provided terminal on the left of this page. For example, type
<pre><code id="sample1" data-language="scheme">(+ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)</code><button class="doit" onclick="doit(sample1.textContent)">send to the terminal</button></pre>
   After pressing "Enter" button you will receive *28*.

   Or you can try more interesting example
<pre><code id="sample2" data-language="scheme">(fold * 1 (iota 99 1 1))</code><button class="doit" onclick="doit(sample2.textContent)">send to the terminal</button></pre>
which is another way of
<pre><code id="sample3" data-language="scheme">(let factorial ((n 99))
   (if (= n 0)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))</code><button class="doit" onclick="doit(sample3.textContent)">send to the terminal</button></pre>

   This will produce factorial of 99 for you
<pre><code>> (let factorial ((n 99))
   (if (= n 0)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
